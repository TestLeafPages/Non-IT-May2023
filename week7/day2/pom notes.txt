Today's Agenda
--------------
Page Object Model
-------------------
----set up for sequential execution
----set up for parallel execution
----Integration of data parameterization
Framework
---------
its a real or conceptial structure intended to guide or support the building of product.

why framework
--------------
----To produce uniform output/result
----To increase the productivity
----Anyone can able to produce same result
----Easy maintenance of script
----Reduce the duplicate code
----supports multi-Lingual application
----support for better reporting(Extend rep,index html)

POM--Page object Model
POM.xml---Project object model
POM--Page object Model
-------------------------
Design pattern to build a automation framework.

selenium java

Testng
apache poi


leaftap
--------
how many page
1.login
2.homepage(crmsfa)
3.leadpage
4.create lead
5.viewlead


POM Implementation Steps
------------------------------
1.Create a BaseClass(ProjectSpecificMethod) for common variables and methods
2.Create java classes for each page that we navigate in the application 
3.Create  methods for each actions and verification in each page
4.All the page related java classes should extents the ProjectSpecificMethod
5.All the methods in the pages should have return type based on the landing page
6.Create new package for testcase create the class for testing
7.Go to projectspecific method to @before and comman method
8.All the testcase java class also should extends base class project specificmethod

ClassRoom
----------
1.Create Maven project
2.Add all the necessary dependencies
3.Create base,pages,testcases package
4.setup baseclass for common variables and methods
5.setup pages for createLead testcase with proper return statement for methods
6.Create testcase for create lead and call the method for pages and execute

How to pass driver from testcase to the pages
1.Create public constructor in all the pages with chromedriver as aruguments
constructor code should be this.driver=driver;
2.pass driver to all construtor call starting from testcases and all constrcutor call method


This keyword
refers current object in a  method or constructor
Here is given the 6 usage of java this keyword.

this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.

ClassRoom
------------
Integrate DataProvider and Apache POI
1.Create excel datasheet under data folder
2.copy and paste readexcel.java under utils package
3.copy and paste the excelfilename dataprovider code in projspemetho(need to corre the import)
4.copy and paste @beforetest(setfilename)into createlead testcases
5.Integrate dataprovider to the testcase
---change the normal method with arg to receive data
----pass the data to the methods in the testcase

Excel----DataProvider----@test
@beforetest----its give filename(createlead)
   @Dataprovider
         @test
