Actions Class
----------------
the Actions class is a feature that allows you to simulate advanced user
interactions involving the mouse and keyboard. 
It provides a set of methods to perform various actions such as clicking,
hovering, dragging and dropping, double-clicking, right-clicking, and entering text.

The Actions class is part of the org.openqa.selenium.interactions package in Selenium WebDriver.
To use the Actions class, you need to create an instance of it by passing the WebDriver instance as a parameter.
Advanced user Interaction

Advanced user interactions:
------------------------------
Mouse and keyboard
Actions class

Action class is not throw any exception
-----------------------------------------
1.MouseHover
-------------
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.moveToElement(webElement).perform();

2.Droppable
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.dragAndDrop(source,destination).perform();

3.Draggable
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.dragAndDropBy(webElement,x,y).perform();
Drag and DropBy

4.RightClick
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.contextclick(webElement).perform();

5.DoubleClick
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.doubleclick(webElement).perform();

6.ScrollDown
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.scrollToElement(webElement).perform();

7.Select
--------
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);

// Step1 : Create object for Actions class
		Actions builder = new Actions(driver);

// step2: use appropriate method to do the action
builder.clickAndHold(WebElement).moveToElement(WebElement).release().perform();

// perform() is mandatory at the end of actions

8.sort the element:
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.dragAndDrop(item6,item1).dragAndDrop(item2,item 3).perform
builder.dragAndDropBy(webElement,x,y).perform();

9.keys action:

builder.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL).click(WebElement).click(WebElement).click(WebElement).click(WebElement).keyUp(Keys.CONTROL).perform();
				other method:
builder.clickAndHold(item1).moveToElement(item4).release().perform();
Keyboard Methods:
======================
sendKeys(keysToSend) : sends a series of keystrokes onto the element
keyDown(theKey) : Sends a key press without release it. Subsequent actions may assume it as pressed. (example: Keys.ALT, Keys.SHIFT, or Keys.CONTROL)
keyUp(theKey): Performs a key release

Mouse Actions:
==========================

click (): Simply click on element
doubleClick (): Double clicks onElement
contextClick() : Performs a context-click (right click) on an element
clickAndHold(): Clicks at the present mouse location (without releasing)
dragAndDrop(source, target): Invokes click-and-hold at the source location and moves to the location of the target element before releasing the mouse. source – element to grab, target – element to release
dragAndDropBy(source, xOffset, yOffset): Invokes click-and-hold at the source location and moves to the location and release
moveToElement(toElement): It shifts the mouse to the center of the element
release(): Releases the depressed left mouse button at the existing mouse location
