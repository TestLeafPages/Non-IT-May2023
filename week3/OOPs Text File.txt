object oriented programming
class:
blueprint

overloading

Static polymorphism/compile time 
two or more method methods in same class different of argument and different data type
java exampl:
subString(start index)
subString(start index,end index)
Indexof(int ch)
Indexof(String,index)

Selenium:
frame(index);
frame(id/name);
frame(WebElement)

overriding
Dynamic polymorphism/RunTime polymorphism

but inherited between them
signature is same
but logic is different

sub class method overriding that from parent class
